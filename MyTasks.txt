SO here in the bounding box which is the box around the player objects detected 
u can show it in terms of x,y,w,h x-y coordinate and width and height
or u can also represent it in terms of x1,y1,x2,y2 where these points are the opposite points on the diagonal

so here in initial runs the sports ball is not being detected I  need to make the  model better and it is detecting ppl out of the court so need to handle that too
too much work bruhh


now after training it to detect the  players refree and ball using the yolov5x model now change the boxes around the detected objects so that
other things are visible and nothin is overlapping
